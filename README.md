# Installation
Head over to **your themes folder, open a command prompt / powershell / terminal / or git bash** and enter the following:

    git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/Discord-Revamp

# Dark Discord 
If you want the coloring for Dark Discord, open the custom.css file and copy everything from darkdiscord.css and paste it into there. Sorry I can't find an easier way to do this since I'm not really that familiar when it comes to github, but it works.

# Credits
big ty to snapperito for giving me the source that they got from lighty and making the previews (so credit to snapperito and lighty for the source)
